Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the Pakistani leader, was reported this week to have cut his government's military and intelligence links with two Islamic extremist groups operating in India, and to have arrested an estimated 100 militant leaders. These actions were in some ways even tougher for Pakistan than its earlier decision to cooperate with the United States' war on terrorism and sever ties with the Taliban in Afghanistan. India has had a mixed response. But it should reciprocate by reducing some forces on its side of the border. For many years, Pakistan has denied that it had anything official to do with the groups on its soil that have been aiding an Islamic uprising in the disputed northern Indian border state of Kashmir. General Musharraf and his predecessors have all spoken of Pakistan offering ''moral support'' but little else. Now, in a sudden turnaround, Pakistani officials are acknowledging not only that these groups have operated with government aid and encouragement, but that they have been responsible for most of the attacks in recent years on civilians in Kashmir, which is India's only Muslim-dominated state. India charges that Pakistan-based groups were also behind an assault on India's Parliament on Dec. 13 in which 14 died, including the 5 attackers.", "abstract": "Editorial hails steps by Pakistan to reduce threat of war with India by cutting links with two Islamic extremist groups operating in India; urges India to respond by reducing military buildup at border", "print_page": "22", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Pakistan's Welcome Gestures"}, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "KASHMIR AND JAMMU (INDIA)"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "INDIA"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "PAKISTAN"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EDITORIALS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "INDIA-INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS-PAKISTAN"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ISLAM"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TERRORISM"}], "pub_date": "2002-01-03T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Editorial Desk", "section_name": "Opinion", "subsection_name": null, "byline": null, "type_of_material": "Editorial", "_id": "4fd219698eb7c8105d797818", "word_count": 631, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/24/opinion/l-death-penalty-inequity-791644.html", "snippet": "To the Editor:    Re ''Death Sentence Overturned in 1981 Killing of Officer'' (news article, Dec. 19): I hope that one result of the overturning of the death penalty against Mumia Abu-Jamal will be a refined media and political focus on the inequa...", "lead_paragraph": "To the Editor: Re ''Death Sentence Overturned in 1981 Killing of Officer'' (news article, Dec. 19): I hope that one result of the overturning of the death penalty against Mumia Abu-Jamal will be a refined media and political focus on the inequality of death penalty sentencing around the country.
