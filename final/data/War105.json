The administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Asa Hutchinson, met a hostile audience later in the day at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco as he explained the Bush Administration's stepped up drug war. The San Francisco district attorney, Terence Hallinan, said that city officials had not been informed of the raid and that it and Mr. Hutchinson's simultaneous visit were the latest insults in an ongoing battle between local and federal officials. ''The city's chief law officials do not agree with the federal government's actions,'' Mr. Hallinan said.
