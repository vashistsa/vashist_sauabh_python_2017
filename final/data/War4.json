Some 3,500 Afghan and Pakistani Taliban men are being held in dangerously squalid conditions in the Shebarghan prison in northern Afghanistan. In our visit to the prison on Jan. 20, we found cell blocks designed for 20 prisoners holding up to 100 men; 8 to 10 toilets for each 1,000 men; bathing facilities outdoors in the mud; and grossly inadequate food and medical care. Dysentery is epidemic. The prison's commander, General Jarobak, told us that ''many, many, many men'' had already died. The American military knows about these conditions and has a duty under international law to ensure that the prisoners are treated humanely.
