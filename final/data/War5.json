It was a rare moment of hope in a country long battered by civil war. The near collapse of talks earlier this month contained an important lesson for the Bush administration and Congress. When President Andr\u00e9s Pastrana threatened to forcibly take back the chunk of southern Colombia he had ceded to the leftist guerrillas three years ago, civilians living in the area became terrified. For as bad as life has been under the guerrillas -- and it has been awful -- the prospect of a Colombian military takeover meant the certain arrival of the murderous paramilitary forces. If Washington continues or expands aid to the Colombian military, it must do so on the condition that the military cut its ties to the paramilitaries. Plan Colombia, the package of aid devised by the Clinton administration and continued by President Bush, calls for cutting military-paramilitary links. But the plan had always allowed these conditions to be waived by the president. Last month Congress took away the presidential waiver. By law, Washington can now provide military aid only if Colombia arrests paramilitary figures, suspends officers suspected of paramilitary ties and prosecutes them in civilian courts. Administrations in the past have been known to get around such restrictions, mainly by exaggerating progress or lying about the death toll. The Bush administration should not give in to this temptation.", "abstract": "Editorial observes that agreement between Colombian government and rebel forces to hold cease-fire talks is encouraging sign, a rare moment of hope in country long battered by civil war; argues that if Washington continues or expands aid to Colombian military, it must do so on condition that military cut its ties to paramilitaries", "print_page": "14", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "The War in Colombia"}, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "COLOMBIA"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EDITORIALS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CIVIL WAR AND GUERRILLA WARFARE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "UNITED STATES ARMAMENT AND DEFENSE"}], "pub_date": "2002-01-21T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Editorial Desk", "section_name": "Opinion", "subsection_name": null, "byline": null, "type_of_material": "Editorial", "_id": "4fd22aad8eb7c8105d7b58a5", "word_count": 480, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/05/opinion/unfinished-war-in-afghanistan.html", "snippet": "More American soldiers -- at least seven -- were killed in combat yesterday in Afghanistan than during the entire period since the war began last October, a telling sign that this conflict is far from over and that more fatalities on all sides can...", "lead_paragraph": "More American soldiers -- at least seven -- were killed in combat yesterday in Afghanistan than during the entire period since the war began last October, a telling sign that this conflict is far from over and that more fatalities on all sides can be expected.

''The Longest Day,'' about the Allied landing in Normandy, made by the World War II generation during the cold war, told us that our cause was just and our men were heroic. Most of the Vietnam War films, like ''Platoon'' and ''Coming Home,'' and many World War I films, like ''Gallipoli'' and ''Paths of Glory,'' tell us about governments that have broken faith with their soldiers and wasted their courage. Appearing in a decade rife with spin, ''Saving Private Ryan'' told us that nothing was more authentic than a soldier's sacrifice.
