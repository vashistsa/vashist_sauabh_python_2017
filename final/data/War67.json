The charges the government has brought against the young American, including conspiring to kill United States soldiers in Afghanistan and aiding a terrorist group, seem more appropriate than treason, which can bring a death sentence. Mr. Walker will face extremely serious charges that could be punished by life imprisonment. As the case proceeds, the Justice Department must ensure that he receives a fair trial. Mr. Walker, a 20-year-old Californian who wandered the Muslim world and joined what he believed to be a holy struggle for the spread of militant Islam, is guilty of abysmal ignorance, twisted priorities and a shocking lack of remorse after Sept. 11. He should be held accountable if he aided terrorist groups and fought against American forces in Afghanistan. Determining whether his actions were criminal can best be done under the safeguards provided by civilian courts.", "abstract": "Editorial lauds Bush administration decision to try John Walker in civilian court for his role with Taliban and Osama bin Laden; notes proving he deliberately acted against his country may be hard", "print_page": "18", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "The Prosecution of John Walker"}, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "WALKER, JOHN"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "BUSH, GEORGE W"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "BIN LADEN, OSAMA"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "NEW YORK CITY"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "WASHINGTON (DC)"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "AFGHANISTAN"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "TALIBAN"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "WORLD TRADE CENTER (NYC)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "AIRLINES AND AIRPLANES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EDITORIALS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CIVIL WAR AND GUERRILLA WARFARE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HIJACKING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TERRORISM"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "UNITED STATES ARMAMENT AND DEFENSE"}], "pub_date": "2002-01-16T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Editorial Desk", "section_name": "Opinion", "subsection_name": null, "byline": null, "type_of_material": "Editorial", "_id": "4fd2124b8eb7c8105d7886a1", "word_count": 463, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/27/world/a-nation-challenged-video-a-gaunt-bin-laden-on-new-tape.html", "snippet": "A new videotaped statement from Osama bin Laden that purports to have been made sometime in late November or early December shows the terrorist leader looking tired and gaunt but alive some three months after the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trad...", "lead_paragraph": "A new videotaped statement from Osama bin Laden that purports to have been made sometime in late November or early December shows the terrorist leader looking tired and gaunt but alive some three months after the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
