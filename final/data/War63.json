(Ballantine, $12.95.) The sequel to ''About Schmidt'' finds its aging antihero, Alfred Schmidt, Esq., recently widowed and resolutely committed to his crabby, bigoted view of humanity, whether railing against ''half-breeds'' (including his young Puerto Rican lover), pushy Jews or overly familiar waiters. ''Begley's adroitly conceived variation on the novel of manners'' is ''a richly nuanced concoction, cut by a lethally dry wit,'' Daphne Merkin wrote here in 2000. It renders ''a superficially unlikable protagonist with the same humanizing fullness other authors save for likable ones.''    NAME-DROPPING: From F.D.R. On, by John Kenneth Galbraith. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $14.) Now in his 90's, the eminent economist recalls in sharp detail his encounters with such figures as Roosevelt, the Kennedys, Truman and even Albert Speer. Galbraith ''has known everyone, or at least everyone who was on speaking terms with the liberal left,'' Godfrey Hodgson said here in 1999, and his ''humor remains as dry as a good martini.''    THUNDER FROM THE EAST: Portrait of a Rising Asia, by Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn. (Vintage, $14.) Even as they illustrate the vast endemic problems in Asian culture and society, the authors, both staff members at The Times and former correspondents in the region, find reason for hope in the emergence of democratic institutions. The result is ''a most memorable portrait of modern Asia,'' Robert Kagan wrote here in 2000.    THE APE AND THE SUSHI MASTER: Cultural Reflections by a Primatologist, by Frans de Waal. (Basic Books, $17.) In a history of primate studies, a leading primatologist argues that culturally acquired behavior is not limited to human beings. Last year in these pages, Douglas Foster called this a ''deftly written, deeply reflective work'' that is ''a remarkable journey of discovery to the heart of a profound question: what can we learn about the evolution of our own cultures by studying the behavior of our primate cousins?''    CROOKED RIVER BURNING, by Mark Winegardner. (Harvest/ Harcourt, $14.) Set in Cleveland from the 1940's through the late 1960's, this novel follows the intertwined fates of a working-class guy who dreams of becoming mayor and the daughter of a political boss, who yearns to be a war correspondent. ''Winegardner weaves the love story through the fabric of a tumultuous era'' in ''a gritty, rich and misjudged city,'' Peter Khoury wrote here in 2001.    THE GREEN SUIT, by Dwight Allen. (Plume, $13.) These 11 connected stories track the emotional coming of age of an aspiring writer, the hapless, low-wattage son of a well-off Kentucky family who is consumed by the women in this life even as they are all too aware of his flaws. ''There are layers of subtle meaning and plotting here; the work not only stands up to rereading but rewards the effort,'' Alice Elliott Dark wrote in the Book Review in 2000.    ON HER OWN GROUND: The Life and Times of Madam C. J. Walker, by A'Lelia Bundles. (Lisa Drew/Washington Square/ Pocket Books, $15.) According to this generous portrait by her great-great-granddaughter, Walker (1867-1919), the inventor of a hair-straightening product that allowed black women to wear the popular styles of the day, overcame a poor childhood to become a brilliant entrepreneur and philanthropist, and an early advocate for women's economic independence. ''Bundles's well-paced and well-written book . . . is as much social history as biography, filled with the detail and texture of culture and politics,'' Margo Jefferson wrote in these pages last year.    CRAZY RHYTHM: My Journey From Brooklyn, Jazz, and Wall Street to Nixon's White House, Watergate, and Beyond . . . , by Leonard Garment. (Da Capo, $18.) Most of this memoir revolves around the author's complex relationship with Richard Nixon, whom he served as adviser, lawyer (in the late stages of the Watergate crisis) and late-night confidant. The result is a ''beautifully written book'' that ''mingles the psychological underworld with the world of power politics,'' David Brooks wrote here in 1997.    ISLAND, by Jane Rogers. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $13.) A girl abandoned at birth vows, at the age of 28, to track down and murder her mother, a quest that takes her to a remote island in western Scotland. Last year our reviewer, Bliss Broyard, found this an ambitious, if flawed, novel whose narrator ''catalogs her grievances and failings with such accuracy and lack of sentimentality that you can't help falling under her spell.''

That arbitrary action rightly offended most of America's allies. By undermining the clear language of the convention, it also potentially endangered future American troops who may fall into enemy hands. The concerns expressed by America's top military commanders on this score may be leading Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to reconsider his initial enthusiasm for this bad idea. Mr. Bush's second thoughts were apparently prompted by a memo submitted last week by Secretary of State Colin Powell. Mr. Powell rightly argued that claims of prisoner of war status could not be decided by Pentagon fiat, but must be resolved by the kind of legal hearing the convention requires. Other administration officials, like Attorney General John Ashcroft and Vice President Dick Cheney, strongly disagree, and Mr. Bush's words yesterday left it unclear which way he would ultimately decide.
