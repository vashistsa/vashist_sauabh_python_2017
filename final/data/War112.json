But when all is said and done, success or failure rests, in one sport at least, on the most fleeting of impressions. That sport is figure skating, and the impressions that count are those flashing through the judges' minds. There can be no recall of Monday night's scoring for the pairs medals. The judges gave the gold, after a flawed performance, to the Russian duo of Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze instead of the Canadian pair Jamie Sal\u00e9 and David Pelletier, who skated perfectly. Any replay will show Sikharulidze faltering on a double axel and Berezhnaya landing stiffly after several aerial maneuvers.
