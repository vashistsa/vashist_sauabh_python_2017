''We need a security force which is effective, highly disciplined and under the control of the government,'' she said. Mrs. Megawati has so far done nothing to correct the behavior of Indonesia's military or police. Their brutal conduct is partly responsible for the conflict in Aceh, the longest-running, most violent and most important of Indonesia's several separatist conflicts. Throughout the 50 years of Aceh's on-and-off war, Indonesia's leaders have made several efforts at a compromise solution. But the conduct of the country's security forces has left the Acehnese unlikely to accept one.", "abstract": "Tina Rosenberg Editorial Observer column cites role played by brutal, undisciplined and underfunded military and paramilitary units in long separatist conflict in Aceh, Indonesia; notes many of abuses are committed for money, with paramilitary police supplementing meager pay with extortion and kidnapping (M)", "print_page": "18", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Editorial Observer; A Guerrilla War Stoked by a Thirst for Cash"}, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "ACEH PROVINCE (INDONESIA)"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "INDONESIA"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ARMAMENT, DEFENSE AND MILITARY FORCES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "WAR CRIMES AND CRIMINALS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "WAGES AND SALARIES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FINANCES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CIVIL WAR AND GUERRILLA WARFARE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "KIDNAPPING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EXTORTION AND BLACKMAIL"}], "pub_date": "2001-12-27T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Editorial Desk", "section_name": "Opinion", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Tina", "rank": 1, "lastname": "ROSENBERG"}], "original": "By TINA ROSENBERG"}, "type_of_material": "Editorial", "_id": "4fd229238eb7c8105d7b266d", "word_count": 799, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/18/world/belgrade-journal-milosevic-spouts-facts-who-s-spilling-secrets.html", "snippet": "A secret document is a sexy thing, a sort of striptease whose lure is less what it reveals than the aching promise.
