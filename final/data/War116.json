Instead the Bush administration has presented a bloated and unbalanced proposal that would deepen future budget deficits, distort national priorities and slow the transformation of America's military forces to respond to the novel needs of 21st-century warfare. Congress must summon the courage to reshape and reduce this undisciplined budget. The administration expects the Pentagon to keep buying costly new versions of obsolete cold-war weapons systems. Every dollar wasted on these arms comes at the expense of alternatives that would actually make America more secure, like speeding military modernization and expanding the range of projects designed to contain the spread of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons materials.
