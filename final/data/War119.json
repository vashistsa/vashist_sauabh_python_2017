That's exactly what Withers, who died in October, did evenings. And she wore a gas mask doing it, while producing by day a magazine unflinchingly of its time and place. Her ascension to editor in chief was a bit like a game of 10 little Indians; one editor became sick, another returned to America, and there she was with her skeletal staff trying to make fashion make sense in insensible times. Paper shortages meant a subscriber literally had to die before someone else could sign on, and Vogue was only available by subscription. While conceding that ''in those days 'fashion' was an autocratic power,'' she used those powers for good, not evil. The tastemakers of the day worked with the government to trick women into thinking they were choosing certain styles out of desire, not necessity. Short hair wouldn't get caught in the machinery women needed to run; so Withers ran photos of ''the trim heads of the actresses.'' She helped popularize fashion that used as little fabric and labor as possible; moreover, she felt, ''The utility scheme brought anguished cries from some designers, but it did a great service to British fashion, which had been far too elaborate and fussy for its health.'' While she wouldn't have been an ideal peacetime boss lady for Vogue, she made the restrictions of the time seem de rigueur.", "abstract": "Amy M Spindler tribute to British Vogue editor Audrey Withers, who died in 2001; photo (M)", "print_page": "43", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Puttin' On The Blitz", "kicker": "THE LIVES THEY LIVED: AUDREY WITHERS, B. 1905"}, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "WITHERS, AUDREY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MAGAZINES"}], "pub_date": "2001-12-30T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Magazine Desk", "section_name": "Magazine", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1}], "original": "By Amy M.
