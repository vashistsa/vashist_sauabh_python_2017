The term preferred by members of the American foreign policy establishment is ''realism,'' which in this context has a very precise meaning. Realists, who hold many of the best jobs in our graduate departments of international relations, foreign policy think tanks and world-affairs commentariat, are a knit-browed bunch. They see reality as a condition of uncorrectable anarchy, particularly the reality of international politics, and one to which the proper response is sternness.
