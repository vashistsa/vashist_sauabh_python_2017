But ''War'' wants to be much more than pitched battles and casualties rendered with up-to-the-minute technology depicting violence. There are, of course, a few obligatory episodes of big-budget brutality wedged into this unwieldy crunch of social melodrama and P.O.W. action movie. But rather than creating dramatic tension or irony, the contrasts combine to result in the oddest thing -- a movie that wants to be everything and adds up to nothing. ''War'' is a film that tries to excel on several levels and falls flat on all of them. Like most movies about prisoners of war, the crudely sentimental ''War'' is set at a German stalag in the waning days of World War II. Colin Farrell is the Hart of the title -- Tom Hart, a lieutenant with no battle experience. ''You really ought to spend a night on the line,'' he's told, and he smiles sheepishly in response. (The movie really doesn't need to signal the carnage that's in store for its protagonist in such an obvious way.)", "abstract": "Elvis Mitchell reviews movie Hart's War, directed by Gregory Hoblit; Bruce Willis and Colin Farrell star; photo (M)", "print_page": "19", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "An Attach\u00e9's Job Ill Prepares Him for the Stalag", "kicker": "FILM REVIEW"}, "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "HART'S WAR (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "FARRELL, COLIN"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "WILLIS, BRUCE"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "HOBLIT, GREGORY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}], "pub_date": "2002-02-15T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk", "section_name": "Movies; Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Elvis", "rank": 1, "lastname": "MITCHELL"}], "original": "By ELVIS MITCHELL"}, "type_of_material": "Review", "_id": "4fd21b268eb7c8105d799d81", "word_count": 1051, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/07/nyregion/boldface-names-508497.html", "snippet": "Sense of D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu      LAURA BUSH, the president's wife, oohed and aahed and said ''How precious'' and ''That's very pretty,'' and told the director of the American Folk Art Museum yesterday that she had seen the museum before....", "lead_paragraph": "Sense of D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu LAURA BUSH, the president's wife, oohed and aahed and said ''How precious'' and ''That's very pretty,'' and told the director of the American Folk Art Museum yesterday that she had seen the museum before.", "abstract": "First Lady Laura Bush and Libby Pataki, wife of New York Gov George Pataki, take tour of American Folk Art Museum in Manhattan; Daniel Pelosi appears in Suffolk County Court for probation violation; Bill Clinton attends party for two of his former aides, James Carville and Paul Begala; former United States Atty Gen Nicholas Katzenbach comments on his son John's book Hart's War, which has been made into movie starring Bruce Willis; photos (M)", "print_page": "2", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "BOLDFACE NAMES"}, "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "HART'S WAR (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "BUSH, LAURA"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "CARVILLE, JAMES"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "KATZENBACH, NICHOLAS"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "PATAKI, LIBBY"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "BEGALA, PAUL"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "CLINTON, BILL"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "PATAKI, GEORGE E"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "KATZENBACH, JOHN"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "NEW YORK STATE"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "NEW YORK CITY"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BOOKS AND LITERATURE"}], "pub_date": "2002-02-07T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Metropolitan Desk", "section_name": "Books; New York and Region", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "James", "rank": 1, "lastname": "Barron"}, {"firstname": "With", "middlename": "Elissa", "lastname": "Gootman", "rank": 2, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}, {"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Adam", "rank": 3, "lastname": "Nagourney"}], "original": "By James Barron, With Elissa Gootman and Adam Nagourney"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd262858eb7c8105d8144ac", "word_count": 689, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/15/movies/film-review-the-horrors-of-the-balkan-wars-as-shrewdly-staged-illusions.html", "snippet": "One of the many unsettling contentions of George Bogdanich's documentary film, ''Yugoslavia, the Avoidable War,'' is its assertion that many of the most horrendous events in the recent Balkan wars were stage-managed for the news media.

A number of the massacres and atrocities reported on television with bodies on display, it maintains, were shrewdly planned illusions concocted by the Bosnian Muslims to inflame international opinion against the Serbs. The city of Sarajevo in particular served more than once as an accessible location for deceptive television coverage. Although it would be inaccurate to label this documentary pro-Serbian, the film, which opens today at the Two Boots Pioneer Theater, methodically sets out to demolish much of the conventional wisdom about who did what to whom and who was to blame.
