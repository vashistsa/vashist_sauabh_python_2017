Ron Kovic, played by Tom Cruise, goes to talk to his commanding officer. Kovic is conscience-stricken because he thinks he killed a fellow soldier in the chaos of an engagement. The officer, though, can't be bothered. He tells Kovic to shrug it off, makes a few perfunctory comments about how confusing war can be and then tries to shoo Kovic out. When Kovic presses, the officer finally snaps and warns him to forget it. Such was military command in Vietnam War movies -- remote and uncaring. It is a far cry from generals blinking back tears as they sent their men into battle in World War II pictures. War movies trace the arc of America's changing attitudes toward combat -- from the na\u00efve effusions of sentimentality in World War II to the bitter cynicism in Vietnam to a renewal of patriotic fervor tinged with nostalgia in recent pictures like ''Saving Private Ryan.''
