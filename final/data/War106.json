Holbrooke's answer to the question of whether a Democratic administration would have prosecuted the war as well as the Bush administration has is Clintonian in its disingenuousness (The Way We Live Now, March 24). Of course the military leadership is essentially the same. But the military acts at the order of the commander in chief, not on its own. Holbrooke's assertion that any president would have responded as Bush did is not borne out by the facts. The previous Democratic administration, in which Holbrooke served, failed on more than one occasion to respond to terrorist acts against the United States in New York, Yemen, Nigeria, Somalia, etc. When it did use the military, it was ineffective to say the least.

It provides more spending for military security and domestic security and more tax cuts for ''economic security.'' But the budget undermines the security of the nation's social safety net and the government's ability to carry out some of its basic responsibilities over the next two decades. It jeopardizes the future of Social Security and Medicare, whose trust funds would be siphoned away to underwrite outmoded military projects and tax reductions favoring the rich. The budget embodies a divisive agenda for which Mr. Bush has no mandate, in spite of his popularity. For weeks the administration has cleverly leaked news about a handful of domestic programs like family nutrition, health research and food stamps that were targeted for spending increases. But the budget the administration presented yesterday revealed that everything outside these few programs was up for assault. According to Mitchell Daniels, the budget director, the administration is targeting only inefficient programs. The cuts, he insists, are not aimed at hobbling job training, environmental programs or labor safety -- although those are some of the areas that will suffer. The administration, he says, is simply trying to do away with bad management. Mr. Daniels has created a virtual axis of inefficiency, and declared war on it.", "abstract": "Editorial says Pres Bush's proposed $2.1 trillion budget undermines nation's social safety net and government's ability to carry out some of its basic responsibilities; says budget is road map toward different kind of American society, in which government no longer taxes rich to aid poor and in fact does very little to protect nation from foreign enemies; says if budget is adopted as proposed, increasing cost of tax cuts over next decade will drain treasury while rapidly rising price tag of unnecessary military projects will make up larger and larger piece of what is left; charges that Bush is using anti-terrorism campaign to disguise ideological agenda that has nothing to do with domestic defense or battling terrorism abroad", "print_page": "24", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "The Axis-of-Inefficiency Budget"}, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "BUSH, GEORGE W"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "NEW YORK CITY"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "UNITED STATES"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "WASHINGTON (DC)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "WORLD TRADE CENTER (NYC)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "AIRLINES AND AIRPLANES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TAXATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EDITORIALS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FINANCES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HIJACKING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BUDGETS AND BUDGETING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TERRORISM"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "UNITED STATES ARMAMENT AND DEFENSE"}], "pub_date": "2002-02-05T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Editorial Desk", "section_name": "Opinion", "subsection_name": null, "byline": null, "type_of_material": "Editorial", "_id": "4fd22cbb8eb7c8105d7b9124", "word_count": 666, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/04/opinion/l-in-afghanistan-for-better-or-worse-457442.html", "snippet": "To the Editor:    Nicholas D.
