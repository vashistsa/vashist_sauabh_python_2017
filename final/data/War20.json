Experts at chewing from the inside out, termites can carve their tunnels within a paper's width of the outside of a piece of wood, remaining out of sight. Even when they accidentally break through, they quickly patch the hole with ''termite mud'' -- a mixture of dirt, excrement and chewed wood. A little pile of dirt on the floor or a mud stain on a wall are often the earliest signs that termites have moved in. By the time termites make themselves visible -- a swarm of ''winged reproductives'' seeking to establish new colonies -- they have been munching for several years. Dr. Nan-Yao Su, an entomology professor at the University of Florida, estimates that Americans spend more than $2 billion annually to eradicate termites. ''That does not account for people paying the carpenter to repair their house,'' Dr. Su said.
