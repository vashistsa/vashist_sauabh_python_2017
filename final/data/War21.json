John Dexter's 1981 production, with enchanting sets and costumes by David Hockney, last seen in 1986, returned on Monday night with James Levine conducting. Dexter made an integrated triple bill out of three French works: Satie's ballet ''Parade''; Poulenc's bizarrely comic opera ''Les Mamelles de Tir\u00e9sias''; and Ravel's sublime ''L'Enfant et les Sortil\u00e8ges,'' about a naughty boy who comes to know compassion. War hovered over the creation of each one. When the premiere of ''Parade,'' with a scenario by Cocteau and sets by Picasso, was presented in 1917 in Paris, the front lines of World War I were just 100 miles away. That same year, Apollinaire's play ''Les Mamelles de Tir\u00e9sias'' was introduced. When Poulenc set it to music nearly 30 years later, France was engulfed in World War II. Though Ravel did not set Collette's 1917 libretto for ''L'Enfant'' until seven years later, he was still shaken by questions of how to go on with everyday life in the face of worldwide threat. Audiences are again grappling with those questions.", "abstract": "Anthony Tommasini reviews Metropolitan Opera production of three French works: Satie's ballet Parade, Poulenc's opera Les Mamelles de Tiresias and Ravel's opera L'Enfant et les Sortileges, conducted by James Levine; photo (M)", "print_page": "1", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Best Defense In the Face Of War", "kicker": "MET OPERA REVIEW"}, "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "L'ENFANT ET LES SORTILEGES (OPERA)"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "LES MAMELLES DE TIRESIAS (OPERA)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "LEVINE, JAMES"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "RAVEL, MAURICE JOSEPH"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "POULENC, FRANCIS"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "SATIE, ERIK"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "OPERA"}], "pub_date": "2002-03-06T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "The Arts/Cultural Desk", "section_name": "Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Anthony", "rank": 1, "lastname": "TOMMASINI"}], "original": "By ANTHONY TOMMASINI"}, "type_of_material": "Review", "_id": "4fd2146f8eb7c8105d78c9a8", "word_count": 696, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/21/world/a-nation-challenged-relic-in-a-cave-but-what-war.html", "snippet": "After raising the haunting prospect that a global positioning device found in Afghanistan had belonged to a serviceman killed in Somalia in 1993, the Pentagon said tonight that it had been lost by a pilot who served in Afghanistan.
